	<h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Essentially all that this does is to allow a developer to gather
        all the tools for a development environment and install them onto
        a Windows machine in a simple and quick manner.<br/>
        For a technical lead it allows a way to control the development set for
        their developers and to know that it was initially installed from
        a standard pattern. A pattern that can be version controlled.<br/>
        The concept is similar to the idea of a <a
            href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/PhoenixServer.html">Pheonix
            Server</a>, which is a server that can be destroyed and recreated
        reliably and at will. &nbsp;This contrasts with the usual <a
            href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/SnowflakeServer.html">Snowflake
            Server</a> which is where each set up is unique and can not be
        reproduced.
    </p>
	<p>The intention is to make it possible to install the entire development environment
		software and set up the environment from a single command.<br/>
    This should allow developers &amp; Tech-leads to ensure all their developers are using the same
    versions of tools and to control the set up from a their GIT repository location.  </p>
    <h2>How?</h2>
    <p>The technology that drives <b>OBSIDIAN</b> is based on Powershell scripts and their ability to load them from a central webserver.</p>
    <p>It is possible to send a script to PowerShell from a webserver and use that script to run commands on the PC.<br/>This is what <b>OBSIDIAN</b> does.</p>
    
    <h2>What does the installer script do?</h2>
    <p>Each of the installation types all have a url associated with them that simply needs to be posted into a 
    windows command window. This will download the Powershell script for execution.</p>
    <p>The download follows these steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Ask for clean installation confirmation, which if selected will DELETE all the installed tools before continuing.
            It is possible if only one tool needs updating to simply delete its folder.
        </li>
        <li>All the required modules are downloaded as ZIP files and exploded into the correct install folder;</li>
        <li>Selected installation packages are executed if newly downloaded;</li>
        <li>Shortcuts are added to the developer's desktop.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>But why &nbsp;<b>OBSIDIAN WEAPON</b>?</h2>
    <p>Simply because the original Powershell scripts came form a project that had a code name. So a new code name was needed to replace all the instances in the script. So a website called <a href="#">http://projectcodename.com/</a>&nbsp;was used to geneate a "cool name".</p>
