This club was established in 1986 and has run uninterruptedly since then.

This is a friendly but disciplined club which consists of men and women from 7-mid fifties. Kids are taught in separate classes. The emphasis is on respectful and safe training in an enjoyable environment. Chief Instructor Colin Lawrence has been training for 28 years and has been running these clubs since 1986. It is an extremely well-equipped club with everything a martial artist needs(focus mitts/kickpads/Thai pads/kick paddles/punch-bag/Escrima sticks/knives/safety sparring gear and a matted area).We cover all ranges from long-distance kicking to groundwork.

Gradings take place twice or three times a year.There is a flexible curriculum and students can set their goals and plan their progress.Many students have graded to 1st and 2nd Dan Black belt.

Students can choose their classes.They can arrive and leave at the beginning or end of any class and do not have to stay all evening (which helps if energy is at a premium).

A.R.C.S (All Range Combat System) includes various Martial Arts. Which include Bruce Lee's J.K.D and Taekwondo. 

**Korean Taekwondo**, **Japanese Karate**, **Thai Boxing**, **Western Boxing**, **Ju Jitsu**, **Kali** and freestyle grappling are some more examples of the sort of martial arts A.R.C.S covers.
