Club clothing code is black trousers with red stripes (&pound;16) and black top (&pound;20),club t-shirt (&pound;15) or any plain black t-shirt (no prints). This is  practical and cheap.
Students also need groin-guard (&pound;16.50) and leather bag gloves (&pound;20).

Alternatively, students can order gear directly from the (http://www.blitzsport.com/) website.
