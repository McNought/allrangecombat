Training is geared to suit the individual. new members of either gender over 12 years old are welcome as are interested spectators who are invited to stay and watch. The club caters for the needs of both beginners and advanced students.

Students pay via monthly standing order of &pound;32 from their bank or building society. This allows the student to attend as many classes as they wish.The student must set this up before training (but may visit and watch the club as many times as they wish beforehand).The student  remains in control of this payment and can continue indefinitely or can cancel if they do not wish to continue training.There is no contract.

The student receives one private lesson free of charge when the standing order has been set up.

Members are also obliged to purchase a Martial Arts Licence which provides full insurance cover and also acts as a grading record. This is only &pound;8 pounds a year and is through the [W.A.K.O.](http://www.wakogb.com/ "W.A.C.O GB")   This provides 3rd party, dental and injury insurance. Further details available upon request.
