In all the Martial Arts, some form of assessment is used The aim of this is to serve as a series of stepping-stones upon which the student can see his/her own progress develop.

A secondary and less important reason for grading is to serve as an outward sign of that individual's level of ability and achievement and to act as encouragement to the other students.

The grading system provides the individual with an attainable objective and through this a sense of achievement and satisfaction which build self-confidence and self-control.

We use the coloured belt system as found in Tae-Kwon-Do:

- White : On Entry
- Yellow : After first grading
- Orange
- Green
- Blue
- Red
- Brown
- Brown II (Black tag)
- Brown III (Black tip)
- Black : First Dan
