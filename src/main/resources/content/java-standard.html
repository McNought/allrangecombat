<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>This is intended to be a standard &amp; minimum tool set for a Java developer.</p>


<h3>Details</h3>
<p>
This set includes:
</p><ul>
	<li><b>JAVA (1.7.0_80)</b> which will be installed with the appropriate <code>JAVA_HOME</code> environment variable set.</li>
	<li><b>Tomcat (7.0.6)</b> An empty version of Tomcat, needs to be run from command line &amp; is not set as a service.</li>
	<li><b>7-Zip (9.20)</b> A windows utility, useful in allowing the developer to open jar files.</li>
	<li><b>Eclipse (STS 3.7.0)</b> The tool suites provide ready-to-use combinations of language support, framework support, and runtime support, and combine them with the existing Java, Web and Java EE tooling from Eclipse. An integrated dashboard in the distribution makes it trivial to install further extensions that add support for technologies such as Pivotal Cloud Foundry, Gradle or Pivotal tcServer. </li>
	<li><b>Maven (3.1.1)</b> Apache Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of information.</li>
	<li><b>Git</b> The Git version provided will run on the command-line. Portable Git (2.6.0) SCM is packaged with a PortableApps.com  launcher as a portable app, so you can use Git on your iPod, USB flash drive, portable hard drive, etc. It has all the same features as Git, plus, it leaves no personal information behind on the machine you run it on, so you can take it with you wherever you go.</li>
	<li><b>Notepad++ (6.8.8)</b> Notepad++ is a free (as in "free speech" and also as in "free beer") source code editor and Notepad replacement that supports several languages. Running in the MS Windows environment, its use is governed by GPL License.</li>
</ul>
