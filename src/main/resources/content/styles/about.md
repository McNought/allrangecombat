Students can grade as high as 3rd Dan Black Belt in Taekwondo, Kickboxing or Mixed arts. This core training brings the power of Thai Boxing, the grace and fluid kicking of Korean Taekwondo, the devastatingly effective art of western boxing , the complex and fascinating weaponary and open-hand defence of Phillipino Kali, the stunning efficiency of Bruce Lee's JKD, and the vastly numerous locks , holds and ground-fighting techniques of Jiu Jitsu (Japanese and Brazilian)....and much more besides! Flexibility and fitness feature strongly.
