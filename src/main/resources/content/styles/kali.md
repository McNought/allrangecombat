Kali is a vast martial art and its weaponry side alone is fascinating. We cover single and double stick, single knife and empty hand defence against weapons.

Panantukan is the empty hand version of Kali and has no sports applications as it is purely a martial art for self-defence. Its trademarks include devastating limb destructions and body limb manipulations prior to striking. It is extraordinarily varied and interesting.
