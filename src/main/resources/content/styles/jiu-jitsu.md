Japanese Jiu Jitsu works with a compliant partner to practice throws, locks and holds. Brazilian Jiu Jitsu is more competative , and more sport-oriented. Both can complement each other.

Standing locks, take downs and ground fighting are practiced in the club both compliantly and against a resisting opponent for self defence and sporting applications.
