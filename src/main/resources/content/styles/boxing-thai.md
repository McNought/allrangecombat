This ancient martial art was originally used in warfare and as a brutal sport between village champions. It is often known as the 'science of 8 limbs' as it uses fists, elbows, knees, feet and shins to damage or knock out the opponent. In this club, the original self-defence applications are taught as well as the more common modern sport version. the club is fully equipped with Thai pads and body-protectors.

Heath and safety are always a priority.
