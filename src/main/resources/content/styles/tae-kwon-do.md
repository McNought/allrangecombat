Tae-Kwon-Do is a martial art that was developed independently centuries ago in Korea, at which time the art was known as "Tae-Kyon".  Tae means to "kick or smash with the feet", whilst "Kwon" is translated as "to punch or destroy with the hand or fist'.  "Do", as in all martial arts means "way or method" and refers to the techniques and underlying moral and spiritual values goven-ting the art. 
Tae-Kwon-Do's underlying principles and values are embodied in the acronym C I P S I which stands for:

- Courtesy
- Integrity
- Perseverance
- Self-Control
- Indomitable Spirit

Tae-Kwon-Do is the application of unarmed combat techniques for self-defence. It was originally developed as an effective means of self defence against war-like neighbouring countries, especially Japan.  In Korea, before the Second World War, Tae-Kwon-Do training was compulsory for all young men from the age of 6 years upwards. When Korea was under Japanese occupation during the Second World War, all practice of the art was forbidden, Tae-Kwon-Do was kept alive by individuals who risked their lives so that the art would not die out altogether, this is a graphic example of Tae-Kwon-Do's perseverance and indomitable spirit in the face of adversity.  After the end of the war, Tae-Kwon-Do once again flourished and was re-integrated into the Korean way of life by General Choi Hong Hi.  Today, Tae-Kwon-Do is the national art and sport of Korea and in its "Full Contact" form has become a recognised sport in the Olympic Games.  Tae-Kwon-Do's spectacular kicks have great destructive power and utilise techniques which are unique to Tae-Kwon-Do.  Tae-Kwon-Do is particularly famous for ifs "Flying Kicks" which in the old days were employed against Samurai Warriors on horseback, a master in the art of Tae-Kwon-Do can leap over 8 feet in the air and deliver a kick which can break a plank of wood an inch thick.  Leighton Buzzard Tae-Kwon-Do Club follows in the traditions of these great masters and provides a friendly, yet disciplined way to achieve health, stamina and moral guidance in the use of the art.  

TaeKwonDo is taught in its traditional form including patterns (Hyung/Poomse) and with sporting applications as well as for health and fitness. There is a great emphasis on kicking. The multitude of kicks, including jumping kicks, are practiced with great regularity, as well as TaeKwonDo sparing applications.
